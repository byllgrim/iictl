# iictl (Work In Progress)
Controlling ii - Manage server/channel connections.

Written in **Ada** because I wanted to learn it.
It would've been cleaner in C.

It sucks a bit, but I hope it will suck less than other irc clients.
TODO link to ii and tii.

## Dependencies
Ada 2005 compiler e.g. gnat.

Florist (a posix library) TODO link.

## Build and install
Build with `make`.

Install with `make install`, maybe prepended with `sudo`.

## Usage
Run `iictl` inside `ii`'s `irc` directory.

You don't have to run `ii` if the directory already exist and is populated.
