# iictl (Work In Progress)
Manage [ii](https://git.suckless.org/ii/) instances and connections.

Written in **Ada** because I wanted to learn it (would've been cleaner in C).

It sucks, but I hope it will suck less than other irc clients.
I'm far too busy to be meticulous.

See also [tii](https://github.com/byllgrim/tii).

## Dependencies
[Gnat and Florist](http://libre.adacore.com/download/)

## Build and install
Use the `Makefile`.

## Usage
If `ii`'s directory (e.g. `~/irc`) exist and is populated, just run `iictl`
from anywhere.

Otherwise, run `ii` first (or create and populate the directory manually).
